# Uncertainity_Aware_Paraphrase_Plagiarism_Detector
## Project Overview
Large language models (LLMs) can rapidly re-paraphrase source text in ways that evade traditional string-matching plagiarism checkers. Exponential growth of LLMâ€‘generated text raises authenticity concerns, so our goal is to: Build a reproducible pipeline that generates watermarked paraphrases and trains a classifier to spot plagiarized text.
